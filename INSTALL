Here is installation description suitable for Debian 7.0 distribution. The procedure for other distros may vary.

1. Make sure you've installed kernel headers package (usually named linux-headers)

2. Compile the module:
> make all

Note: the following actions must be done with root privileges.

3. Install the module:
> make modules_install
> depmod -a

Note that Acer C120 provides USB mass storage interface, so it can be grabbed by generic usb-storage driver.
This will prevent GM12U320 driver from loading. To force GM12U320 driver loading follow this way:

4. In the directory /etc/modprobe.d/ create file gm12u320.conf with the following line:
install usb-storage /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install gm12u320 && /sbin/modprobe --ignore-install usb-storage

5. OK, now we need to modify initramfs image in the same way. Add the following line to /etc/initramfs-tools/modules:
gm12u320

6. Now trigger rebuild of initramfs:
update-initramfs -u

7. Most distros wont grant the user access rights to the framebuffer device. cd /dev && ls -la | grep fb1 will show the permitted group, typically 'video'. 
Either add the user to this group or cp over the /etc/udev/rules.d file to automatically grant any user in users access to the device.

It's done, have fun!
